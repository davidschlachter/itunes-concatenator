Like [Join Together](http://dougscripts.com/itunes/itinfo/jointogether.php), but with chapterizing again.

Works both in macOS 10.15 Catalina's Music app as well as in iTunes on earlier versions from at least Mac OS X 10.9.

Download the latest version: [Track Concatenator](https://github.com/davidschlachter/itunes-concatenator/raw/master/bin/Track-Concatenator_2020-08-15.zip)

More information at [Track Concatenator homepage](https://www.davidschlachter.com/misc/trackconcat).

FFMPEG and MP4v2 must be installed in order to concatenate. Concatenates MP4/AAC files losslessly, other formats are reencoded at the highest input bitrate as MP4/AAC.
